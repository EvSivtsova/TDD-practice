You've heard about testing, and even better "Test-Driven Development", but you're still not sure exactly what they are. Well now you'll know!

In this trail, thoughtbot developers Harry Schwartz and Ian C. Anderson cover core principles of writing code with Test-Driven Development. You'll learn about the benefits of testing, the way testing first applies positive design pressure to your code, and how to apply TDD to your own development.

Topics include the red-green-refactor loop, tests as living documentation of your code, why your test code shouldn't necessarily be free of duplication, leveraging your tests to lower risk when refactoring, and strategies for balancing integration and unit tests.

An included exercise offers an opportunity to get your hands dirty with RSpec and improve an existing test suite.
